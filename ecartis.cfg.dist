# Global Ecartis configuration settings

# mailserver: The outgoing SMTP mailserver.  Often the machine
# Ecartis runs on.

# Addresses
# listserver-address: The e-mail address this copy of Ecartis runs as.
# listserver-admin: The e-mail address for the local Ecartis admin.
# listserver-full-name: The 'friendly name' that will show up on mail from
#    ecartis.
#
listserver-address = ecartis@yourdomain.com
listserver-admin = root@localhost
# listserver-full-name = Ecartis

# Meta directory information
# listserver-root
#    This is where the main ecartis executable is located on a default
#    install.   Defaults to the path the program is executed from.   Not
#    useful in it's own, but used to build the other variables defaults.
#
# listserver-conf
#    This is where the config files (such as global blacklist, virtual host
#    configs, etc are located.   Defaults to listserver-root.
#
# listserver-data
#    This is where the writable data directories (lists, queue, archives, etc)
#    live by default.  Defaults to listserver-root.
#
# listserver-modules
#    This is where to load the Ecartis modules from.   Defaults to
#    listserver-root/modules
#
# listserver-root = /home/ecartis
# listserver-conf = /home/ecartis
# listserver-data = /home/ecartis
# listserver-modules = /home/ecartis/modules

# List directory
# In the situation where you are virtual hosting, you could in fact
# store all the lists in seperate places.
# If you do, you will need to run different copies with different config
# files for things like procbounce or procdigest, but that's the price you
# pay for virtual hosting
lists-root = lists

# Ecartis logfile location
logfile = ./ecartis.log

# Paranoia (boolean)
# Are we a paranoid installation?  Paranoid installations only allow
# admin functions to be done by hand.  Defaults to OFF if not specified.
#paranoia = off

# Do we refuse to parse RFC822 'From:' headers?  Otherwise RFC822 headers
# can be used as the sender's address.
deny-822-from = no

# Define the debug level, ranging from 0 (no debug) to 10 (highest
# currently defined).  Determines how much debugging info is written to
# the logfile.  Default is 0.
debug = 0

# Change this to a valid email address at your site
# Default, if list-owner isn't set.
list-owner = root@localhost

# sendmail-sleep should be set to yes to make Ecartis 'sleep' 5ms
# after receiving a response from RCPT TO.  Some Sendmail servers
# die if you don't delay.
sendmail-sleep = no

# sort-tolist is useful for sendmail installations, where the delivery
# order is determined by the order of RCPT TO... it helps make the
# delivery more efficient.  However, more 'intellegent' mailers like
# Postfix and qmail do not really need this option, and it only wastes
# a bit of RAM and processing time on a list send.
#
# Sendmail users would do well to leave it set to 'yes', qmail and
# Postfix users, turn it off.
sort-tolist = yes

# task-no-footer: When set to yes, turns off the Ecartis version
# tagline at the bottom of list results.
# (Hint: Set to 'no' if the development team sends you a new
# version every day. :-) )
task-no-footer = no

# Allow or disallow the 'setaddy' command.  Setaddy allows users
# to modify their addresses.  This is primarily for users of
# NetCom, for example, which sends the messages from
# user@pop45.ix.netcom.com, and then bounces messages replied back
# to this address.  Setaddy allows these users to specify their
# send-to address as user@netcom.com and Ecartis will still accept
# messages from their fudged-up address.
allow-setaddy = yes

# 'full-bounce' controls whether bounces contain the entire
# message or just the headers.
full-bounce = no

# max-rcpt-tries defines the number of times to try getting
# input from sendmail on 'RCPT-TO'.  Sometimes sendmail delays
# and leaves the socket buffer empty.  Usually, you should never
# need to set this.
# max-rcpt-tries = 5

# How long should cookies be kept before they're expired and
# removed?  Defaults to 3 hours.
# cookie-expiration-time = 2d

# How long should the 'Expiry-Date' header field time be from now?
# Mail programs that support this feature will automatically delete
# mail older than this.  This is only used for generic command output,
# for the message you get back from things like 'lists' and 'who' and
# the output of setting your flags.  Files sent (closed-post notices,
# etc.) are not given an Expiry-Date.  Defaults to 1 day if not set.
# reply-expires-time = 4h

# LSG2 Configuration
# lsg2-cgi-url: The full URL of the location of the LSG/2 CGI, ie.
# lsg2-cgi-url = http://full.url/cgi-bin/lsg2.cgi

###################################
#

#                 who sends mail to a closed list, but is not
#                 subscribed to the list.  This is probably a good
#                 place to explain what a mailing list is, and
#                 subtly suggest they subscribe :-)
#
# The digest-header-file and digest-footer-file specified below
# violates the RFC1153 standard for digested mailing lists.
# However, they seem quite popular :-)
#
# digest-header-file:  The filename for the textfile prepended to
#                      the head of digests when they're sent out.
#                      Path is relative to list directory.  This

#                            Path is relative to list directory.
#                            This is the file you retrieve with
#                            'getconf digest-administrivia'.
#
# nopost-file: The filename for the textfile to be sent to a user whose
#              post was rejected because they were set nopost.  This is
#              the file you retrieve with 'getconf nopost'.
#

#           commercial e-mail.  'getconf spamfile' gets this one.
#
# moderator-welcome-file: The filename of the textfile to be sent to a

#                         contain an introduction to moderating the
#                         list, and serves as a welcome/intro to the
#                         new responsibilities a user has.
#
# administrivia-regexp-file: The filename of the file containing regexps,
#                            one per line of patterns to match when attempting
#                            to determine if a users mail to the list
#                            contains an admin request which should have gone
#                            to <list>-request instead.  Retrieve with
#                            'getconf administrivia-regexp'.
