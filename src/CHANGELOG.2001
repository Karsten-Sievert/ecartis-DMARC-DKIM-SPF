[12/16/2001] -- PWL
  -- Updating the CHANGELOG, to force the creation of a new snapshot 
     tonight.  Rachel fixed an compile bug in the per-user module that 
     was blowing up compiles.

[11/20/2001] -- RCB
  -- Added Rik van Riel's 'antispam-checkbody' patch.  Set
     antispam-checkbody to 'true' to check the body of mail as well as the
     headers for spam patterns.
  -- Added an option parameter to the extended listbox template parameter
     for LSG/2: you can set the listbox size in rows.

[11/16/2001] -- RCB
  -- Added 'rfc2369-legacy-listid' to allow X-List-ID to still be added.
     Defaults to 'true' for backwards compatibility.
  -- Added 'use-rfc2919-listid-subdomain' to allow List-ID to add the
     'list-id' portion of the suggested namespace into the List-ID field.
     Defaults to 'false' for backwards compatibility.

[11/15/2001] -- RCB
  -- Changed X-List-ID header to List-ID header, since it's now more
     widely accepted and used. :)

[11/14/2001] -- RCB
  -- Fixed LSG/2 to log when people are subscribed or unsubscribed to
     lists by the web interface.  Whups!
  -- Added 'per-user-list' to the per-user modification variables, which
     is the list the user was added from, in the case of cc-lists
     situations.  Makes it nice and easy to tell what list gave you
     a message even for virtual cc-lists!
  -- Applied 'kjh's patch to allow the userlist in LSG/2 to be sorted.
     This patch was contributed back from FreeLists.org, courtesy of
     John Madden.  I altered it, to make it optional; you can set
     lsg2-sort-userlist off in order to disable it and use the old
     behavior.

[11/13/2001] -- RCB
  -- Caught and fixed a bug with copy-requests-to that John Madden
     pointed out.  WHUPS!

[11/09/2001] -- JLT
  -- Fixed a couple of compile errors under my linux box

[11/08/2001] -- RCB
  -- I hate my job.  Someone please shoot me, or find me a new job.
  -- Pulled out the new MIME library due to some unforeseen problems.
  -- Interim 1.0.0 release to revive code 'life' outside of my sandbox.
  -- STILL PENDING PRIOR TO FULL 1.0.0 RELEASE:
     + sorted userlists in LSG/2
     + the new MIME library
     + documentation!
  -- Fixes to per-user code.

[10/16/2001] -- RCB
  -- Did rather extensive code-review, made some notes for redesign.
     This is what took me the majority of the last two months.  I would
     LOVE some help on this! :)
  -- Added peruser module, which does per-user re-addressing and per-user
     footers.  Per-user bounce detection is not in place yet because,
     honestly, it'll be hard to do in a mailserver-agnostic way.
  -- Added 'per-user-footer' file to the files list, for per-user footers.
  -- Added 'per-user-rewrite-to' boolean variable, to toggle the
     per-user To: field rewriting.
  -- The to: field rewriting definitely needs more work; data could be
     lost if multiple addresses are on that line.  This is a temporary
     solution to make sure it works at all. :)

[08/05/2001] -- RCB
  -- Added new bounce handlers, for SMTPv, MMS Relay, and a few unknown
     mailers.
  -- First preliminary Ecartis checkin!  As far as I know, it will work,
     but I have not yet had a chance to really test it as I am commiting
     this during a brief free moment at work.  Here's hoping!

[08/03/2001] -- RCB
  -- Finally finished changing all 'Listar' references to 'Ecartis'...
     I hope!
  -- Made sure that all 'listar-*' config variables (which are just
     internal aliases to 'listserver-*' anyway) are still supported,
     so that config files do not need to change.
  -- Added 'prevent-second-message' variable.  If this is set and the
     welcome or goodbye files exist, the Ecartis command results
     file will be eaten.  IF YOU HAVE OTHER COMMANDS IN A MAIL BEFORE
     THE SUBSCRIBE COMMAND THEIR OUTPUT WILL GO AWAY.  Remember this
     caveat. Anything after the subscribe will generate additional
     command output, though.
  -- Tweaked archive handling a bit.

[07/25/2001] -- RCB
  -- Applied Balu's patch for 'welcome-subject' and 'goodbye-subject'
     modifications
  -- Applied Mark Femal's patch for better admin subscribe/unsubscribe
     handling.

[06/07/2001] -- BALU
  -- Added support for welcome-subject and goodbye-subject.

[02/25/2001] -- RCB
  -- Fixed a permissions bug in LSG/2 handling.

[02/23/2001] -- RCB
  -- Fixed the 'help' command to properly pull from 'listserver-data'
     instead of 'listserver-conf'

[02/22/2001] -- RCB
  -- Added 'copy-requests-to', which if set will be the address all user
     requests will be cc'd to.  This is useful for debugging, so you can 
     see when users get errors on requests, but could also generate a
     truly huge amount of spam.  USE WITH CAUTION!

[02/19/2001] -- RCB
  -- Added new 'public_file' and 'private_file' API calls, changed
     PantoMIME to use public_file to make PantoMIME'd binary files 
     world-readable always.

[02/13/2001] -- RCB
  -- Added a 'closed-post-subject' variable, which overrides the
     "List 'listname' closed to public posts" subject for closed-post
     file responses.

[02/11/2001] -- RCB
  -- Fixed the 1/26/2001 fix to not have a bug in it. :)

[02/10/2001] -- RCB
  -- Fixed LSG/2 cookies to expire again.  The bug was introduced when
     site-specific information was added to the 'SITEDATA' subdirectory
     and the cookie expiration routine wasn't updated.

[02/08/2001] -- JLT
  -- Fixed a bug referring to 'tempban-end-file' as 'tempban-off-file'.
     (bug reported by Dave Olszewski <daveo@osdn.com>)

[01/26/2001] -- RCB
  -- Made LSG/2 username stuff case-insensitive.

[01/11/2001] -- JLT
  -- Fixed the variable hashing function so that it was case-insensitive
