[12/31/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed a typo of 'adminmod' which should have been 'adminmode' in
     modules/acctmgr/sub.c line 833 (Thanks to Mark Femal <mark@beantree.com>)
     for pointing it out.
  -- Happy new year everyone!

[12/16/2000] -- RCB
  -- Added 'lsg2-paranoia' variable which controls whether or not the
     LSG/2 admin screen is operable.

[12/07/2000] -- JLT
  -- Added patch from Francois Petillon <fantec@proxad.net> which helps
     Listar handle quoted printable and base 64 encoded subjects in a saner
     fashion.

[12/06/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed a few lingering places where gethostname() rather than
     build_hostname was used.  (thanks to KUSANO Takayuki
     <AE5T-KSN@asahi-net.or.jp>)

[12/03/2000] -- JLT
  -- Patched codes.c as requested by John Goerzen to fix a compile warning
     on Debian under the Alpha platform.
  -- Updated debian control files slightly, again as per changes submitted
     by John Goerzen.

[12/01/2000] -- RCB
  -- Added a 'posting-acl' behavior.  'posting-acl' determines whether or
     not to check the posting-acl-file, and defaults to true.  The
     posting-acl-file defaults to 'postacl'.  It works just like 
     subscription acls, but is used to determine if non-subscribers can
     post to a closed-post list or not.  This behavior only applies to
     closed-post lists.

[11/27/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed the patch made by Alessandro to correctly use <$list> instead of
     <?list>

[11/22/2000] -- JLT
  -- Added a patch by Alessandro Zummo <azummo@ita.flashnet.it> which
     provides an unsubscribe-confirm-file similar to the
     subscribe-confirm-file which already existed and a way to set the
     subject for unsubscribe and subscribe confirm messages.   If a subscribe
     or unsubscribe confirmation file exists, that text is used *instead of*
     and no longer *in addition to* the stock text.   If you still want the
     'stock text' you should add it with appropriate Liscript expansions to
     your subscribe-confirm.txt file.
  -- Fixed slightly incorrect defaults for some of listserver-data,
     listserver-conf and listserver-modules.  They were defaulting to
     <$path> instead of <$listserver-root> meaning that if you set
     listserver-root in the config file they were not being correctly
     expanded.
  -- Changed a bit of nested variable expansion in the listserver-root/data/
     conf/modules area.  For some reason the nesting there was causing
     memory corruption and segfaults.  *THIS NEEDS TO BE DEBUGGED FURTHER*

[11/16/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed a // comment in one file (codes.c) which prevent it from 
     compiling under any compiler which didn't understand C++ style
     comments.

[11/10/2000] -- JLT
  -- Cleaned up the lists-root change slightly, and added a
     'get_var_unexpanded' to the LPM api so that this could be done other
     places.
  -- Applied 3 patches supplied by Francois Petillon <fantec@proxad.net>
     One fixed a bug with an empty subject.  The second hopefully fixes 
     some problems with dealing with quoted-printable encoded subjects.
     The third fixed a bug where users could unset the NOPOST flag on
     themselves under some circumstances.

[11/10/2000] -- RCB
  -- Added a new '-buildaliases' command which will rebuild the aliases
     for an entire site.  Useful for refreshing listar.aliases :)
  -- Fixed a bug related to lists-root, so that things like:
       lists-root = lists/<$hostname>
     would work properly.

[11/07/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed a crashing bug in administrivia where the input file was
     getting closed prematurely.  Fix provided by P.Y. Adi Prasaja
     <adi.prasaja@fetp.org>

[11/04/2000] -- JLT
  -- New bounce handlers, courtesy of Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>
  -- A couple of potential infinite loops repaired by Jouni Malinen
     <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>

[11/03/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed an infinite loop with listar handling postfix bounces. (LB #271)
  -- Fixed an uninitialized variable error in bouncer.c (LB #275)
  -- Fixed a bug where a Resent-From: in the body of the message could
     override a from line (LB #250)
  -- Fixed bug with USE_HITCHING_LOCK, patch provided by Francois Petillon
     <fantec@proxad.net> (LB #266)
  -- Applied patch for duplicate sending bug submitted by Jouni Malinen
     <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi> (LB #274)
  -- Fixed a bug with an oddly formed DSN Final-Recipient line.   The code
     assumed the semicolon was always followed by a space, and in this one
     it was not (reported by jkmaline@cc.hut.fi)
  -- Fixed another problem with rabid-mime and bounce handling.  Patch
     supplied by jkmaline@cc.hut.fi not used in preference to a slightly
     cleaner implementation.

[09/19/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed a bug in LSG/2 where list subscribers could not view
     the list membership even if the setting was 'private'.

[08/19/2000] -- RCB
  -- Added Michael Blakeley's patch:
     + fixes an SMTP send bug with the newer SMTP code
     + adds 'silent-resubscribe', a boolean that can disable
       the normal resubscribe warnings.
     + Adds 'subscribe-confirm-file', the contents of which will be
       included into a subscribe conirmation request.
  -- Minor fixes to Michael Blakeley's patch. :)

[08/10/2000] -- RCB
  -- For Ron Brogden, added:
      + smtp-retry-forever (boolean)
        This variable, if set true, means that Listar will not limit
        itself to a finite number of IO polls while waiting for a 
        reply.  This could, potentially, lead to a Listar lockup if the
        SMTP server does not ever answer.
      + smtp-blind-blast (boolean)
        Put Listar in 'naive trusting' mode; namely, it hands data to
        the mailserver and assumes an instant 'okay' reply to each.
        IF YOU USE THIS, I strongly recommend turning on something like
          sendmail-sleep = yes
          sendmail-sleep-length = 1 s
        or you are likely to flood your mailserver, badly.c

[07/19/2000] -- RCB
  -- Added message number headers to digest altertoc mode.  Voila. :)

[07/17/2000] -- RCB
  -- Added '-admin' cmdarg for -newlist.  So you can do
       listar -admin foo@bar.com -newlist mylist >> listar.aliases
     And voila, non-interactive list creation. :)

[07/13/2000] -- RCB
  -- Changed Pantomime URL logic to properly escape to %20 for spaces when
     printing the URL in a message. :)
  -- Fixed socket-timeout default to be '30 s' instead of '30s'.

[07/07/2000] -- JLT
  -- Moved BCC check to the first presend check performed so that spammers
     don't even get a chance to take up a lot of our CPU.   It's not clear
     whether it should be handled after the unqoute/unmime or before, so
     I chose before and hope this is correct :)

[07/06/2000] -- JLT
  -- Slight change to RPM spec file so that it will hopefully force the
     correct permissions

[07/05/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fix for PantoMIME to make it set permissions on Pantomime-stripped
     files properly.

[06/29/2000] -- JLT
  -- As per report by P. Y. Adi Prasaja,  removed the bogus sprintf from
     line 689 of moderate.c, causing us to currectly remove our .appout.*
     temp files.

[06/28/2000] -- JLT
  -- Attempt to fix the post-install script for RPM which broke when Rachel
     added SMRSH detection

[06/27/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed the bug which caused a moderated post on a list which had
     reply-to-sender (it required both of those settings) which caused
     the mail to show up with a reply-to address of the moderator who had
     approved it.  **Rachel: Please take a look at the changes I made
     to moderate.c and make sure I'm not breaking some hidden assumption
     since I don't have any moderated lists to test this on.  Other people
     if you have moderated lists, please test this out as well and make
     sure I didn't foobar something**
  -- Fixed bug reported by Darren Nickerson which caused the moderator's
     queuefile instead of the original to be sent back to the submitter of
     a moderated post when moderate-include-queue was true

[06/27/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed silly little formatting bug in make_moderated_post
  -- I'm off to Dragon*Con!  Whee!

[06/26/2000] -- JLT
  -- Oops, belated changelog entry.  Fixed a bug in the code when running
     on OpenBSD which caused the cookie timeouts to expire pretty much
     immediately

[06/21/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed nasty logic bug in LSG/2 auth routines.
  -- Fixed quirk in fix. :P  Okay, it has't been a great day for me
     code-wise, I'm sort of harried at work. :)
  -- Updated Listar SPEC file to handle SMRSH detection.

[06/19/2000] -- RCB
  -- Changed the appsub/appunsub ticket generation to wrap at 60 columns
     instead of 65, in hopes of being friendlier to people using busted
     web-mail services which shall (*cough*Yahoo*cough*) remain nameless.

[06/14/2000] -- RCB
  -- Changed the description of 'megalist' to be more specific about 
     what making a list purely disk-resident really means.

[06/13/2000] -- RCB
  -- Listar.org is back up for public consumption!  Ouch, that was
     painful.

[06/12/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed compilation on OpenBSD

-- Listar.org crash, site down.  Rachel's birthday CHANGELOG goes in here
   normally. --

[04/28/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed what I broke in the specfile last night.

[04/27/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed up some small glitches in the spec file to make things a bit
     nicer.   With any luck, this RPM should now automatically invoke
     the upgrade functionality on the base configuration when it's
     installed, as well as having the scripts, modules and templates
     directories owned by the right user, and as well as setting the correct
     permissions on the home directory.
   
[04/26/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed setup of per-user modification stuff to actually let it work if
     someone builds something on that hook.
  -- Added per-user-datafile internal variable so that the source file being
     sent for the per-user modification could be recovered by hooks
     themselves.
  -- Care should be taken so that if two per-user hooks do not clobber each
     other by both reading from the source and then writing to the queuefile.
     Only the first hook should.  Subsequent hooks should read from the
     per-user queuefile and write back to that same queuefile.
  -- Added code to unlink the per-user queuefile when it is no longer needed.
  -- Added variable 'assume-lists-valid' which disables the statting of
     the config and users files to check if a list directory is a real
     list.  This variable defaults to no.

[04/25/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed empty message body bug.  Yack!

[04/24/2000] -- RCB
  -- Added Bcc checking; if you set 'enforced-addressing-to' to be the 
     list address, any posts that do not have the list address in either
     the To or Cc fields will be made moderated.  If you set
     'enforced-address-blackhole', any posts which fail the above check
     will simply be silently eaten.
  -- Fixed a bug in the cheatsheet writing routines, so that VAR_CHOICE
     variable defaults are properly written out.
  -- Fixed a compile bug in LSG/2 under AIX.
  -- Fixed a cute race condition that only happened under my own
     debugging method if I mistyped a command.  Still, best not to have
     it.
  -- Fixed the long-standing quoted-printable bug for /real/ this time. :)

[04/20/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed a long-standing quoted-printable character bug where decoded
     messages would not always properly have the transfer-encoding
     reclassified as 8bit instead of quoted-printable.

[04/18/2000] -- JLT
  -- Did some longneeded reorganization on config variables, trying to
     get them into more useful sections than 'General', 'Global',
     'List-Specific', etc.  I'm sure it's not great yet, so if you see
     a variable and think it belongs somewhere else, tell me.
  -- Fixed file-archive-status which should have been a VAR_CHOICE but
     wasn't (choices are public, private, admin denoting who can view the
     file archives associated with a given list)

[04/17/2000] -- JLT
  -- Release 0.129a released
  -- Updated SPEC file and version.h to reflect new numbering scheme.
  -- Next version of Listar *WILL* be 1.0.0

[04/17/2000] -- RCB
  -- I decided to start developing Listar under my real name.  I've
     made the appropriate changes to all the readme files.  Any questions,
     feel free to ask me.
  -- Listar 0.129a snapshot seems stable, so I'm going to call this the
     release point.  JT will build the release sometime tonight. :)

[04/15/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed typo in unsubscribe-mode choice list (confirm was spelled config)

[04/13/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed SUPERADMIN being settable via LSG/2 bug.
  -- Fixed ADMIN users being able to alter settings on other admins via
     LSG/2.  SUPERADMINs still can.

[04/13/2000] -- JLT
  -- Started going through the bug database and picking off low-hanging fruit
  -- Fixed grammatical error noted in LB#209
  -- Fixed listserver footer info in flagged_send_textfile routines to
     obey the task-no-footer directive.   (TODO (still): rewrite the
     flagged_send_textfile routine to use the tolist)
  -- Fixed the typecast bug reported in LB#219
  -- Fixed the missing unsubscribe status result reported in LB#220
  -- Fixed submode command to work like subscribe in obeying the
     admin-silent-subscribe variable. (LB #220)
  -- Changed send-as in the bouncer-unsub-file/bouncer-vacation-file to
     be the listar bounce address.  They are already bouncing.. what's one
     more, and as pointed out in LB #221, a human doesn't need to see it.
  -- The subscribe-acl is now ignored if the admin is doing a hand
     subscribe of the user (LB #222)
  -- Added descriptions/examples for the variables noted in LB#227
     (task-no-footer, lsg2-cgi-url, lsg2-cookie-duration)
  -- Set list-owner to initial admin by default in config file (when
     a list is created via -newlist (LB#229)).
  -- Fixed bug where subscribing an already subbed user via LSG/2 sent
     Listar into an infinite loop (LB #240)
  -- Fixed LB #242 where a CHOICE type var would output the default as
     the full array of choices rather than just the currently set default.

[04/12/2000] -- JLT
  -- Reworked liscript if block processing to handle nested if blocks
     correctly.

[04/11/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed bug in passwd.c when UNCRYPTED_PASS was defined (primarily win32)

[04/10/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed lockup on moderation.

[04/07/2000] -- RCB
  -- More MIME fixes.

[04/07/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed another bug in the spec file.

[04/06/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed spurious linefeed bug.

[04/06/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fixed Rachel's fix for templates being included in the spec file.
     They were being copied to the install dir, but not packaged as files
     for the distribution.

[04/04/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fix to build_hostname; the change made to cope with the busted
     behavior Debian GNU/Linux displays worked on other Linux systems,
     but not on SunOS, Irix, and several others.
  -- Fix to re-include crypt.h for SunOS where needed.

[03/30/2000] -- RCB
  -- Minor bouncer tweak.
  -- Fixed (hopefully) the Quoted-printable bug.
  -- Fixed (hopefully) the some-MIME-not-handled bug.
  -- Added default LSG/2 templates, made LSG/2 default web interface
     option.

[02/11/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed a cute bug where the Postfix bounce parser did not stop
     parsing when it got down into the message itself, thus causing
     potential spinlocks on anything that looked like a Postfix bounce
     down in the message but could not be parsed.
  -- Added Exim support to Bouncer.
  -- Added 'Original-Recipient' support to the MIME-bounce handling, as
     it is more likely the correct one.

[02/10/2000] -- RCB
  -- Changed how hostname resolution is done, at John Goerzen's
     request after noting some machines return just the local machine
     name (e.g. 'foo') on gethostname, while others return the FQDN
     (e.g. 'foo.bar.com') on the same call.  Now Listar has a
     build_hostname function which will always return the FQDN.

[02/08/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixed variable description problem that caused a line wrap in
     config files.
  -- Fix for X-original-sender problem on moderated posts.

[02/04/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fix for compile bug under some compilers, due to uninitialized
     variable.
  -- Fix for -upgrade on BSDI

[02/03/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fix for the doubled digests

[02/03/2000] -- JLT
  -- Fix to make sure that upgrade actually creates the directory that the
     version file sits in before trying to write the version file initially.
     Without this, the *upgrade never happened* unless the SITEDATA dir was
     hand created.

[02/02/2000] -- RCB
  -- Fixes to moderation code, to eliminate occasional files remaining
     around in the queue directory when forwarded via MIME.
  -- Fixes to append_file and expand_append.  Oog.  I cannot believe I
     overlooked some of those mistakes.
  -- Fixed Liscript expansion in footer files.
  -- Minor tweak to variables.
  -- Fixed upgrade version file location problem, which caused Listar
     to not -upgrade any virtual host other than the first one.

[02/02/2000] -- RCB
  -- Bouncer 2 checked in.

[01/25/2000] -- RCB
  -- I've taken far too long to get back to this, but I have been eaten
     alive at work; my team lead quit and I have had to move into his
     position.  But I will make an effort to catchup on my work for here.

     IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to this lack of time, and the fact that JT has
     been unable to code on Listar for a while and will likely remain so
     for the immediate future, I am desperately seeking more developers.
     Especially since I am beginning layout and design work on Listar2K,
     which is the development name for the full Listar rewrite.

  -- Several fixes to Liscript variable formatting.
  -- Moved all site data files (restrictvars, cookies, site-passwords)
     that used to live in the top-level lists directory for a given site
     into a SITEDATA subdirectory.
  -- Added crypt() support to site passwords; -upgrade will automatically
     convert over.
  -- Added expand_append API function.
  -- Made most of the textfiles use Liscript properly.
  -- Fixed a moderation bug where the moderator was treated as the sender
     except in modpost situations.
  -- YOU MUST RUN AN UPGRADE.  For every 'site' on your Listar install,
     you need to do:
       listar [-c <config>] -upgrade
  -- I ran these changes through a quick regression check, but I will
     not have time to really check them in-depth until tonight.  In
     other words, Your Mileage May Vary. :)
  -- Bouncer rewrite should be in tomorrow, maybe tonight.  I know it is
     a vitally important thing.  Once that and a few more bugfixes are in,
     I will release 0.129a.
