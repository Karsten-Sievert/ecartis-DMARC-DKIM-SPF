[04/17/2003] -- SPL
-- quick fix for buffer sizes for filenames in pantomime, which got
partially screwed in the "fix all possible buffer overflow" period.

[04/16/2003] -- SPL
-- Added quick comment to ecartis.cfg.dist about LSG/2
   configuration option.

[04/04/2003] -- RCB
-- Brought Windows port back up to date.  Yeek.  This is
   TOTALLY untested, beyond the 'it compiles and I could
   run some basic checks' level.

[03/18/2003] -- RCB
-- Moved antispam check to before closed-post check, to allow
   for antispam on moderated submission lists.

[03/11/2003] -- RCB
-- Added -repost as an alias for -approve

[03/09/2003] -- RCB
-- Added some additional debugging output to LSG/2 and LCGI.
-- Removed old debugging output from LSG/2.

[03/03/2003] -- RCB
-- Minor quirk in 'admin' mode for who-status with LSG/2 fixed.
   Thanks to Chris Scott for finding and fixing this. :)

[02/27/2003] -- RCB
-- Fixed serious security flaw in LSG/2.   Guh.
-- Since I'm back in the codebase, added 'moderate-verbose-subject'
   to config variables, which allows you to see who a moderated
   post is from in the subject line when it's sent to moderators.
   This will help me stay sane on the 'ghiblink' mailing list. :)

[02/10/2003] -- SPL
-- commit another patch from Pavel Kolar that seems to fix the archiving
   and union-lists.

[02/07/2003] -- SPL
-- commit patches by Pavel Kolar for fixing how Subject is parsed in
   digest based on order in headers
-- commit 2 patches from Tomas Ogren, one that fixes some issues with Quoted-Printable
   and the other which prints which list a post was declined from.

[01/23/2002] -- SPL
-- committed fix for bug introduced by adi's prior patch, that made
   headers appear after attachments in multipart messages with both
   humanize-mime and humanize-html on.

[01/15/2003] -- SPL
-- added patch to fix the "First line always blank" problem, from adi
   (thanks adi, again!)
-- added another patch from adi to unmime.c to fix the "7BIT" bug
