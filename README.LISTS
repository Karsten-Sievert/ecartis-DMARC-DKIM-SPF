There are two support mailing lists for Ecartis.  'ecartis-support' for
general support questions and answers, and 'ecartis-dev', for those who
are interested in the development aspects, and in having input in the
development process.

To subscribe to either list, send e-mail to 'ecartis@ecartis.org' with:

'subscribe <listname>' (where <listname> is ecartis-support or
ecartis-dev) as the message subject.

Both lists will give you instructions on how to use them once you join. :)
