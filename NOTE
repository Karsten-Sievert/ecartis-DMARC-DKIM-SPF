This is ALPHA SOFTWARE.... or classified as such, despite being more
stable than some release software. :)

Run at your own risk.  It's currently provided (with minimal
documentation) for those who run their own systems and are interested in
looking at the software, either to provide advice or suggestions, to help
in bug-testing, or whatever.

Thanks!  We welcome input, patches, documentation, whatever.  We hope to
make this into a very good stable solid mailing list package for people to
use.
